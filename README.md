 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Analysis using R

## üß† Project Overview

This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build classification models and analyze which features are most effective in distinguishing between **malignant (M)** and **benign (B)** tumors.

The analysis was done using R and focuses on:

- Model comparison: Logistic Regression vs LDA vs Decision Tree
- Feature importance: Identifying the most predictive features (radius, texture, symmetry)
- Statistical significance: Using t-tests to find differentiating characteristics

## üìä Dataset Summary

- **Source**: [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
- **Records**: 569 samples of cell nuclei
- **Target Variable**: Diagnosis (`M` = Malignant, `B` = Benign)
- **Features**: 30 numeric attributes describing cell nuclei characteristics (mean, standard error, and worst)

---

## üîç Questions Addressed

1. **Which classification algorithm performs best?**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   - Decision Tree

2. **Which features best separate malignant from benign tumors?**
   - `radius_mean`
   - `texture_mean`
   - `symmetry_mean`

---

## üß™ Methodology

- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV using `caret` package
- **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy
- **Model Comparison**:
  - **LDA** performed best (95.78% accuracy)
  - Followed by **Logistic Regression** (94.38%)
  - **Decision Tree** trailed behind (89.52%)

- **Feature Importance**:
  - **Statistical Testing**: t-tests on mean values across diagnoses
  - **Model-Based**: `varImp()` used to measure influence in models
  - **Findings**:
    - `radius_mean` had highest statistical separation
    - `texture_mean` was most impactful for Decision Trees
    - Logistic Regression showed balanced importance across all three
